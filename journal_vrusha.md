Final Journal

For the final project I worked on the illustrations of the human organs and later created svg animations. 
While working on ths project I had some issues understanding Git at the beginning, but somehow managed by taking help from the instructor and my teammate. It was definately useful to learn Git and terminal which helped my for my other class as well. For the svg animations I spent lot of time researching for fancy animations,hence I created for four organs only. It was fun and cool creating svg animations because I learned for the first time and usually I create animations only in Afetr Effects. I tried different kind of svg animations such as with strokes, opacity, scaling and color hover. When it comes to group project, it was tough collaborating with other members in coding projects. I realized its easier to collaborate in design class because everyone is assigned specific tasks, whereas, it was difficult for me to merge someone's code. I think we could have tried different way for communication and collaboration but at the end we did make it work. I am satisfied with the end result though some polishing work needs to be done and will work on it in future.
