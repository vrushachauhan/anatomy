Final Group Project: A site that explains parts of the body interactively. 
						         (We still have not decided on a detailed topic yet)
                     
What the instructor needs :

1. Major Interactive Function
2. Clickable Page (ex. open things up&close), Multiple page.
3. Event element (grab a attention more than a minute)
4. Same layout but differnt contents. 
5. Time line.

Brainstorming for ideas

For what reasons do you intend to introduce each organs?
What are the organs in charge of the most important part of the human body? They show their functions as 
animations and vector images.
It is too much to describe all the organs of a human being.
It is appropriate to describe five to eight organs contained in one large context. Here’s examples below.
Ex1. Only the organs that help to absorb when drinking water and function in the body are explained.
Ex2. The commands and muscles of the cell that are necessary for human walking.
Ex3. Describe the process of ingesting food and defecation. (major interactive function)
	    Describe the role of the organs that play the most important role in the process. (sub interactive function)
Ex4. Each nutrient comes into our body and helps us.
Ex5. Symptoms that occur within 5 minutes when the heart stops
Ex6. Explanation of bones in our body, position and connection state of bevelling, 
           direction of movement explanation
Ex7. The side effects of High blood pressure on the body
Ex8. Types of blood vessels in our body, arteries, capillaries, veins. 
	    Explain the institutions that are related to where they go
Ex9. 12 Cranial Nerves & Basic functions. 
Ex10. Animation of each institution and air intake and exhaust processes required for breathing.
